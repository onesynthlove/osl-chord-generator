# osl-chord-generator

This thing uses MIT Labs' music21 to generate popular MIDI chord patterns in Python.

Version 0.1 It basically loops through all of the standard chord progressions for each key. I-I-I-I through VII-VII-VII-VII for Keys C, C#, D, Eb (E- in music21 notation), E, F, Gb (G-), G, Ab (A-), A, Bb (B-), and B

There's a bunch of test scripts in there with me learning music21, kept in there for posterity. I'm using this thing for commercial purposes (eventually to create a music generator based off of machine learning work I did with some Markov stuff)

I was going to license it under the WTFPL, but github doesn't recognize it as a valid license, so it's under the MIT license. Do what thou wilt with it.

The world is a better place with competition, so feel free to compete with OneSynthLove in the marketplace, and let's make Music Producers live better!
